# Code Refactor Starter Code - Webpage for Horiseon Social Solutions Services

## Code Refactor

Refactoring existing code to improve it without changing its functions; so as to meet certain set of standards, make it more accessible or implement a new technology. In this project, a marketing agency "Horiseon" has hired us to refactor their existing site. 

## Installation

1. Downloading the starter code files provided.
2. Creating a local repository using Git and initiating it to create a remote repository in GitHub.
3. Debugging the code to meet the Acceptance Criteria plus improving the code base such as build efficiencies by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing elements in a logical sequence and including comments before an element or section of a page.
4. Use VSCode to make necessary changes, frequently commiting with clear messages , add the changes using Git and push to GitHub.
